### Calendar
The legend for colours:
First blue is the follicular days. Grey is when they started doing LH tests. Green/blue is the luteal phase.
If the hour is written in the cell, it means the meeting took place then.
Pink is when they report a positive result of the LH test, pink hour is on the date that the peri-ovulatory meeting took place.
Yellow is a peri-ovulatory meeting, but in a cycle that was potentially anovulatory - participants did not report positive results of the LH test.
Red is the first day of the next menses.

A032: red # bg_colors[23]
AF05: pink # bg_colors[44]
AD19: pink # bg_colors[61]
DS51: pink # 
EL66: pink # bg_colors[90]
